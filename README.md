# Face Filter CV Project

A browser-based real-time face filter system built as a computer vision exercise, not a UI demo.

## Philosophy
- MediaPipe is used strictly as a facial landmark sensor
- All geometry, stabilization, and pose estimation are implemented manually
- Focus on explainability, performance, and failure analysis

## Current Status
- [x] Day 1: Webcam + facial landmark visualization
- [ ] Day 2: Geometry-based face alignment
- [ ] Day 3: Temporal stabilization
- [ ] Day 4: First filter
- [ ] Day 5: Head pose estimation
- [ ] Day 6: Performance & failure analysis

## Tech Stack
- React + Vite
- MediaPipe Face Mesh
- Canvas (initially)
